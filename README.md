This repository provides a collection of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental deep learning models built and trained using the **MNIST dataset**. Each script is designed to be executed independently.

| Model Type | Description | Execution Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear NN** | Trains a basic **Neural Network** composed solely of fully connected layers. | `python3 train_nn.py` |
| **CNN** | Trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, specialized for image processing tasks. | `python3 train_CNN.py` |
| **VAE** | Trains a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, a powerful model used for generative tasks and learning latent representations. | `python3 train_vae.py` |

### 🚀 How to Run the Examples

To start training for each model, simply execute the corresponding Python script in your terminal:

```bash
# Train the Linear Neural Network
python3 train_nn.py

# Train the Convolutional Neural Network
python3 train_CNN.py

# Train the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
python3 train_vae.py
